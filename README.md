LogiKEy Workbench (dataset of formalized knowledge): Flexible, Pluralistic Foundations for Legal and Ethical Reasoning, Metaphysics and Maths

For further information on LogiKEy see the 
- related [scientific article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10187) in "Artificial Intelligence" [(doi)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2020.103348), and the 
- related [data article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.106409) in  "Data in brief" [(doi)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.106409).

The LogiKEy Workbench also maintains selected datasets in 
- [Computational Metaphics](Computational-Metaphysics) and
- [Foundations of Maths](Maths-Foundations)

All these datasets utilize the universal meta-logical reasoning approach in which various object logics (and their combinations) are shallowly embedded in classical higher-order logic.
