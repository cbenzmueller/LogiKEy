I declare that the bachelor's thesis I am submitting is entirely my own work except where otherwise indicated. I declare that 
I have clearly indicated the presence of all material I have quoted from other sources, including any diagrams, charts, tables or graphs
and that I have clearly indicated the presence of all paraphrased material with appropriate references. 
This thesis has not been submitted, either partially or in full, for a qualification at any other university.\\
