\title{Conditional normative reasoning as a fragment of HOL
  (Isabelle/HOL dataset)}
\author{Xavier Parent and Christoph Benzm{\"u}ller}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
 We present a mechanisation of (preference-based) conditional
 normative reasoning. Our focus is on \AA qvist's system {\bf E} for
 conditional obligation and its extensions. We present both a
 correspondence-theory-focused metalogical study and a use-case
 application where we study Parfit's repugnant conclusion.

Our contribution is explained in detail in \cite{J68}.  This document presents the corresponding Isabelle/HOL dataset.

\section{Introduction}
In this document we present the Isabelle/HOL dataset related to
\cite{J68}, in which \textit{``We report on the mechanization of (preference-based) conditional
normative reasoning. Our focus is on \AA qvist's system {\bf E} for
conditional obligation, and its extensions. Our mechanization is
achieved via a shallow semantical embedding in Isabelle/HOL.  We
consider two possible uses of the framework. The first one is as a
tool for meta-reasoning about the considered logic. We employ it for
the automated verification of deontic correspondences  (broadly
conceived) and related matters, analogous to what has been previously
achieved for the modal logic cube.  The equivalence is automatically
verified in one direction, leading from the property to the axiom. The
second use is as a tool for assessing ethical arguments. We provide a
computer encoding of a well-known paradox (or impossibility theorem)
in population ethics, Parfit's repugnant conclusion.''}
